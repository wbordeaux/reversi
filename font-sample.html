    <p class="lede">A Grocery Store Garlic Obession</p>
    <p class="copy">At first you might think that Professor Patterson was kidding. 
    A little commentary about garlic mentioned here. A little anecdote in passing 
    there. Upon reflection, however, it would become clear that the mentions 
    belied a deep set obsession with the odiferous bulb. Making many 
    question whether there was a vampire trauma in his past.

    <p class="description">It was an obession that would eventually lead to his demise.</p>
